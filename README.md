# ReSolv

Code of the paper "Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential".

The scripts to execute the code are the following: 

1. **Train an U_vac MLP on the QM7x dataset**: examples/FreeEnergyScripts/QM7x scripts/Nequip_QM7x_Prior.py

2. **Precomptue trajectories**: examples/FreeEnergyScripts/QM7x scripts/TrainFreeEnergy/BAR_HFE_trajectory_generator.py \
   which can be called from the bash script BAR_HFE_generate_trajectories.sh within the same directory.

3. **Train the BAR-HFE model**: examples/FreeEnergyScripts/QM7x scripts/TrainFreeEnergy/BAR_HFE_training.py, \
   which can be called from the bash script BAR_HFE_train.sh within the same directory.

## Installation

1. Create virtual environment with Python 3.10 and activate it
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.10 venv
```
2. Install all required packages: <br/>
```
pip install swig, gym[box2d]
pip install -e .[all]
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pip install "jax[cuda]==0.4.23" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pip install h5py, rdkit, scipy==1.12, imageio, networkx, dill
```
or use the requirements.txt file. If you use the requirements.txt, you still need to install the local chemtrain and 
jax with cuda support (second last line above):
```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. pip install "jax[cuda]==0.4.23" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
3. Install chemtrain from the repository
```
